three types of objects in the api response

- Event
	- id => int
	- type (name) => string
	- Actor() => obj
	- Repository() => obj

- Actor
	- id => int

- Repository

- Payload (commitComment)

we have to nest them

Class/Record Event:
	- Actor actor;
	- Repository repo;

Event types

each event has it's own payload object, which is unique

the payload obj has different types of values by each eventype

overall idea is create a base event class with common properties, then create
derived classes for each event (pull, push, watch etc) which implements it's own payload

but the idea is to manage it in the http response dynamically

how can i do that?
